  <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">What is a Micro-Frontend?</h1>
  <p class="mb-4">
    A micro-frontend is an architectural style where a frontend application is decomposed into individual, semi-independent "micro" applications. Each micro-frontend is responsible for a specific feature or functionality and can be developed, deployed, and maintained independently.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4">
    This approach is inspired by microservices architecture in the backend, aiming to bring similar benefits to the frontend, such as improved scalability, flexibility, and maintainability.

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Key Benefits of Micro-Frontends</h2>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
    <li class="mb-2"><strong>Independent Development:</strong> Teams can work on different parts of the application simultaneously without interfering with each other.</li>
    <li class="mb-2"><strong>Technology Agnostic:</strong> Each micro-frontend can be built using different technologies, allowing teams to choose the best tools for their specific needs.</li>
    <li class="mb-2"><strong>Scalability:</strong> Micro-frontends can be scaled independently, improving the overall performance and responsiveness of the application.</li>
    <li class="mb-2"><strong>Maintainability:</strong> Smaller, focused codebases are easier to maintain and update, reducing the risk of introducing bugs.</li>
    <li class="mb-2"><strong>Deployment Flexibility:</strong> Micro-frontends can be deployed independently, enabling faster release cycles and reducing downtime.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Overall, micro-frontends provide a modular approach to building large-scale frontend applications, promoting better collaboration, faster development, and more resilient systems.
